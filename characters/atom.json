    "Integrated Protection": "Your body has built-in defensive layers, which can be enhanced with armor:\n- You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class.\n- You can don only armor with which you have proficiency. To don armor other than a shield, you must incorporate it into your body over the course of 1 hour, during which you remain in contact with the armor. To doff armor, you must spend 1 hour removing it. You can rest while donning or doffing armor in this way.\n- While you live, the armor incorporated into your body can't be removed against your will."
